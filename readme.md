# Automatic File Organizer for Downloads Folder

This Python script automatically organizes files in your Downloads folder by moving them into subfolders based on their type (Documents, Images, Music, Videos, Executables, etc.). Any file that doesn't fit into the predefined categories will be moved to an "Others" folder.

## Features

- **Automatic Sorting**: Organizes files into subfolders within the Downloads folder based on their extensions.
- **Predefined Categories**:
  - **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, etc.
  - **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.jpeg`, etc.
  - **Videos**: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, etc.
  - **Music**: `.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.
  - **Executables**: `.exe`, `.py`, `.kt`, etc.
  - **Others**: Files that donâ€™t match the above categories will be moved to an "Others" folder.
- **Customizable**: You can easily add new file types or modify existing ones in the script.
